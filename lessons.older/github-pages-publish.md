# Publishing Your Website

In this exercise you will be publishing your website to the internet using GitHub Pages.
Don't worry if your site is not complete or doesn't look good. The internet is so very vast that no one will find your site. However, you will be able to give the url to your friends so you can show them if you wish.

You will need to create a GitHub account with a user name. Developers take their GitHub user name very seriously as potential employers will be looking at it to see what the developer knows what to do. Many developers use their real name (your shouldn't) and some, like me, use a handle. Mine is 'klequis'. If you search GitHub for klequis you will find me.

Your GitHub user name should not be too silly. Try to make is something you would be happy to have other people get to know you as.

## Preperation
1. Decide which email account you will use and log-in before you begin the steps below.
2. Find your website files on you computer. You will be uploading them later so make sure you know how to find them.

As usual, there are a lot of steps. Follow them carefully and ask for help as soon as something goes wrong.
